The characteristic they share is that they are all salty.\n\nThe punchline comes right after and goes \n\n> *\"They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard.\"* \n\nLupe could have just said this line and got the message across but he didnt. Instead, he chooses a more audacious \nroute to simulaneously demonstrate how \"hard\" he goes (in his raps). \nNot to mention Lupe simultaneously starts the hunting scheme (dogs, deer, shotguns, hunt) which makes it even harder. \n\nIn the end, you have something much more illustrative than just saying *\"I go hard when I rap.\"* \n\nLupe puts the \"*proof in the* ***pudding***.\""
